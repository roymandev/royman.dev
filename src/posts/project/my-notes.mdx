This application was originally from my submission in Dicoding course "Learn to Build Web Apps with React", but the notes are temporary and reset when refreshing the page.

After the course, I want to practice my front-end skills so I recreate the application with firebase as the backend to store the notes and authenticate users.

## Tech used

- React with Typescript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Jotai for state management
- Firebase for database and authentication

## Todo

- Make as PWA
